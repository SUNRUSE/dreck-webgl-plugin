# [Celluloid Engine](../readme.md) > Math

Vector math helpers; these lean heavily on mutating given instances rather than creating new instances to reduce garbage collection pressure.

## Primitive types

These imitate their GLSL equivalents:

```typescript
import type { Float, Mat2, Mat3, Mat4, Vec2, Vec3, Vec4 } from "celluloid-engine";

const float: Float = 1;
const vec2: Vec2 = [1, 2];
const vec3: Vec3 = [1, 2, 3];
const vec4: Vec4 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const mat2: Mat2 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const mat3: Mat3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
const mat4: Mat4 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16];
```

## Transform calculation

This function calculates a world transformation matrix matching that which would be generated by Blender in XYZ Euler mode:

```typescript
import { Mat4, calculateTransform } from "celluloid-engine";

const mat4: Mat4 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0];

calculateTransform(
  3, // Translation on X.
  -7, // Translation on Y.
  12, // Translation on Z.
  1.3, // Rotation around X axis, in radians.
  -0.5, // Rotation around Y axis, in radians.
  2.1, // Rotation around Z axis, in radians.
  4.5, // Scale factor on X axis.
  6, // Scale factor on Y axis.
  10.1, // Scale factor on Z axis.
  mat4
);

// mat4 now contains a world transformation matrix as would be generated by Blender meeting the above criteria.
```
